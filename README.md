Adafruit Python DHT Sensor Library
==================================

Python library to read the DHT series of humidity and temperature sensors on a Raspberry Pi or Beaglebone Black.

Designed specifically to work with the Adafruit DHT series sensors ----> https://www.adafruit.com/products/385

Currently the library is only tested with Python 2.6/2.7.

For all platforms (Raspberry Pi and Beaglebone Black) make sure your system is able to compile Python extensions.  On Raspbian or Beaglebone Black's Debian/Ubuntu image you can ensure your system is ready by executing:

````
apt-get update
sudo apt-get install build-essential python-dev
````

Install the library by downloading with the download link on the right, unzipping the archive, and executing:

````
sudo python setup.py install
````

See example of usage in the examples folder.
